# Expense Tracker
This is a pet project I am working on to learn the fundamentals of CRUD style webapps.

## Features
Its a simple webapp where you can:
  * add transactions
  * create budgets and categories
  * visualize and track your spending
  
## Tech
I decided to use the LAMP stack. (PHP as backend and MySQL as database) <br>
For the frontend I used a Bootstrap template and a few javascript frameworks, namely Chart.js and DataTables. <br>
The icons are from FontAwesome (Free Version) 

## Here are a few images:
